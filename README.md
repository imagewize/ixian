<h1>Ixian</h1>

A lean full-site-editing theme for WooCommerce stores.
</div>

## Description

Ixian is a full-site-editing (FSE) WordPress theme for WooCommerce stores, built as a general-purpose e-commerce base for small and medium businesses. Unlike Imagewize's [Elayne](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne) theme, it ships **no bundled patterns** — `theme.json`, WooCommerce block templates, and style variations provide the design system, and pages are composed directly from blocks.

Ixian pairs with the [Aludra](https://github.com/imagewize/aludra) block library (mega menu, carousel, FAQ tabs, and more), but doesn't require it — the theme is a plain block theme that works with core blocks and any block plugin.

> **Lineage:** Ixian is a companion theme to Imagewize's [Elayne](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne) and [Nynaeve](https://github.com/imagewize/nynaeve) themes. Like Elayne, it ships no custom blocks of its own — content blocks come from the shared [Aludra](https://github.com/imagewize/aludra) plugin, per WordPress.org's theme-review rules. (Nynaeve is a separate case: it registers its own blocks and doesn't use Aludra.)

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.6+
- PHP 8.0+
- WooCommerce (for store templates)
- Aludra plugin (recommended, not required)

## Features

- **Design system** — `theme.json` defines the color palette, typography, spacing, and border radii; color/spacing slugs match what Aludra's own block styles and patterns expect (`base`, `contrast`, `secondary`, `main`, `primary`, `accent`, `tertiary`, `border-light`).
- **WooCommerce templates** — `templates/single-product.html`, `templates/archive-product.html`, `templates/product-search-results.html`, and `templates/coming-soon.html` are theme-provided; cart, checkout, and category-archive templates fall back to WooCommerce's own block-theme defaults. The product archive and search results ship a results count, catalog sorting, a filters sidebar (price, category, availability, rating) and an empty state; the single product template uses the block-based add to cart, with theme layouts for simple and variable products in `parts/`. The coming-soon template wraps WooCommerce's coming-soon block with the theme's header and footer.
- **Degrades without WooCommerce** — with the plugin inactive, the store templates and the header's mini cart are filtered out rather than left to render as unsupported blocks. WooCommerce's own bundled patterns are unregistered when it *is* active, keeping the inserter consistent with the theme's no-patterns design.
- **Two page templates** — `page.html` (default) omits `post-title` since most pages get their title from a block's own heading; `page-with-title.html` (selectable per-page under Page → Template) adds the conventional title treatment.
- **Style variations** — see `styles/` (e.g. `twilight.json`) for alternate color palettes on top of the same design system.
- **No patterns** — block-first composition. Insert `aludra/*` blocks (or core blocks) directly into pages and templates.

## Theme Integration for Aludra

The Aludra mega-menu block requires its host theme to register a `menu` template part area. Ixian does this in `functions.php` via the `default_wp_template_part_areas` filter, so mega menu template parts created in the Site Editor appear under **Appearance → Editor → Patterns → Template Parts → Menus**.

## Development

```bash
composer install
composer run lint       # php-parallel-lint syntax check
composer run wpcs:scan   # PHPCS against phpcs.xml
composer run wpcs:fix    # PHPCBF auto-fix
```

No JS build step is required — the theme ships no bundled JavaScript.
